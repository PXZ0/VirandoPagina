## About
E-commerce of books and book manager for book lovers and great stories.

## Why?
It was a project created as a grade in the web development course I took, so it has a lot of bugs and errors, which will be fixed.

But, this project is part of my personal portfolio, so I want to add improvements, precisely so that it serves this purpose. I am improving my studies and looking for new technologies to remake it the way I would like it to be.
